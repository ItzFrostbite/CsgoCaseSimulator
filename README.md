# CsgoCaseSimulator
A case opening simulator that will tell you how many of each skin rarity that you got the total cost and you can enter the case cost to simulate a more expensive case. I will be adding soon the skin condition (Ex, Factory new, field tested). Note: At the end it will say stattrack next to a rarity that is saying for example there are 14 blues and 2 are stattrack not 14 blues and 2 stattrack blues.
